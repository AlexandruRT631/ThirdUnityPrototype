# ThirdUnityPrototype

## What is this?

This is the third project from the third unit of the Junior Programmer Pathway from ```learn.unity.com```. In this unit, we had to make a game where the player runs and has to jump over obstacles. There was also a challenge in which we had to fix a game in which we control a balloon.

## Gameplay

### Prototype 3

In this game, the player runs indefinitely to the right side and has to jump over the obstacles that appear in his way

### Challenge 2

In this game, the player has to control a balloon and avoid obstacles while also collecting points.

## Controlls

### Prototype 2

The player can jump by pressing space and dash by pressing left shift.

### Challenge 2

In this game, only one button is used, space, which makes the balloon fly further up

## Building the game.

The game can be built by simply downloading the source code, opening it in Unity Hub, and using unity's utility to built the game for the desired platforms. Selecting which game is built is done by selecting which scene to built.
